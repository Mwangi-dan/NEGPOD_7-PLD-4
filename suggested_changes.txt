As you are aware, with this project submission we are supposed to make some changes
in accordance with the new concepts like OOP and Database management we have learnt.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I want us to use this text file as a check list of the tasks we have to accomplish before
the day of presentation:

1. Implement our code with OOP
    - Possible classes:
        * Users 
        * Question and Answer validation
        * Game play

2. Incorporate database management (MYSQL):
    - User database that records:
        * Login information
        * Scores: High score etc.

3. Clean up our code

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

This gets me thinking of the flow of our solution. Give me feedback about it.
